# JURF
[Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) Challenge entry app. This is my first MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular & Node.js) App and I hope not the last one, since I like these technologies and I really enjoy doing things with them :)

Don't hesitate on commenting & suggesting me fixes. I am newbie on this, so feel free to guide me.

# Requirements to run the app
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* ~~Browser~~

Make sure you configured everything on the ``config.json`` file (db_host, db_name, apikey, api url & static data url). Once you've done, just run this 2 commands to install dependencies and fire the app:

``npm install``

``npm start`` or ``node app.js``
